## About

*Conan recipe for [QuaZIP (LGPL-2.1, zlib/png)](https://github.com/stachenov/quazip). QuaZIP is the C++ wrapper for Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package (AKA Minizip) using Trolltech's Qt library. If you need to write files to a ZIP archive or read files from one using QIODevice API, QuaZIP is exactly the kind of tool you need.*

The recipe assumes you already have Qt5 installed, so make sure that QTDIR is in your PATH.
